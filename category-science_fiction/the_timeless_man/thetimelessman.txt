Originally published in Other Worlds Science Stories as a 2-part serial in the June and September 1956 issues, this 87,500 word novel by Roger Arcot tells the story of James Canfield who found himself made young again, with a whole life before him—but as another man! It isn't easy to live somebody else's life, but Canfield adapted himself to the incredible role—until he found out about the GORKEN! Then his new life became a thing of terror that might last a hundred years, or a hundred days. He hadn't been told how long his new youth would last! And to make it worse, he was now the potential gateway into his universe of a fantastic being from ... another dimension? What WAS the Gorken? Human ... or just—IT? There was a girl, too. Was he supposed to love her, or hate her? He didn't know! And one slip was a sentence of death. And who was Picozzi—and THE ONES? How could he succeed in such an incredible masquerade! More, how could he reach into another Time and another Space, to kill a creature who was ABSOLUTE MASTER of an enslaved world three hundred years from now!
